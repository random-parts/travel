#### **Arrival**

[Schiphol] to [Amsterdam Central]. Yes, you were just dropped into the center of a huge shopping mall after clearing customs. No, you are not going the wrong way - keep following the train signs. Head to the train station ticket counter for an `OV-chipkaart`. The airport itself has its own library & museum - making it one of my favorite airports ever.

#### **Check-in && out**

Once you have a chip card `CHECK IN` on the yellow post before heading down to the train platform. Might also want to pay attention when trying to `CHECK OUT`; or enjoy your walk to [Amsterdam Central] the next day to find out why you card is not working. **[hint: That `4€` train ride yesterday from the airport just got upgraded to `20€` - scanning the card at the _correct_ chip-reader is kinda important]** You can get this refunded once a year by calling their customer service number. .if you are fluent in Dutch.

#### **Something different**

Need more excitement? For the extreme sports enthusiast out there looking for an adventure, rent a fixed-gear bike and only use that to get around town. Do you enjoy mental stimulation and challenges? Park your rented bike at the [3-story] bike [parking garage] then try to find it the next day without the help of photos.
